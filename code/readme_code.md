In the dataset, we have samples from liver, brain, and plasma.
All animals were aged from 18m to 26m.
Other variables including sex and genotypes.
The animals were divided into 2 projects based on the study design.
- 1. Animal at 18m, not only the changes in brain are important, but also need to check the interactions between liver, brain and plasma.
- 2. Animal at ~26m, mainly focus on the changes in the plasma.
- 3. Additional comparisons between 18m vs 26m in the plasma could performed after that
